The context discusses a variety of topics including programming languages, hacking, essays, wisdom, intelligence, variation in wealth, and more, but does not specifically mention activities or things to do in San Francisco. Without any relevant information provided in the context, I cannot definitively state what is the most fun thing to do in San Francisco.
