The context discusses a variety of topics related to programming languages, startups, business deals, etc., but does not specifically mention any fun activities in San Francisco. The one sentence that references San Francisco says:\n\n\"The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John D. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect himself from becoming one. He once told a Sunday school class 'Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard? Because I never took the first drink.'\"\n\nThis sentence does not give any information about fun things to do in San Francisco. Since the context does not provide enough information to directly answer the question about the most fun thing to do in San Francisco, I cannot provide a clear answer based strictly on the given context.
