The only mention of San Francisco is in an apparent hypothetical quote that says:\n\n\"The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\"\n\nHowever, this seems to just be used as an example of a potential library function, not an actual recommendation.
