The context discusses a variety of topics related to startups, programming languages, wisdom vs intelligence, addictiveness, and technological progress, but does not specifically reference activities or attractions in San Francisco. Without any information provided in the context about San Francisco activities, I do not have enough information to definitively state what the most fun thing to do there is.
